							to get the software to work and we want to be able to have people contribute fixes to

							For better understanding, let's dive into the depths of history!
					</section>

					<section style="font-size: 36px;">
						The history of the phenomenon goes back to ancient times. When computers 
						were the size of a small house, software development was mainly carried out in 
						universities and research institutes at the order of the government and large firms. 
						Copyright manners were free, programmers' deeds (with rare exceptions) went from hand 
						to hand and one research institute to another, everyone was satisfied, no one complained.
						It was especially common in the so-called hacker culture, from which the 
						majority of American FOSS leaders and great people in IT history came out.
						And by "hackers" are meant people who loved programming, loved exploring what they could do with computers.
					</section>

					<section style="font-size: 36px;">
						<p>But in 1976, Bill Gates appeared with his angry letter, the so-called "The Open Letter to Hobbyists". 
						The letter was written to early personal computer hobbyists, in which Gates expresses dismay at the 
						rampant software piracy taking place in the hobbyist community, particularly with regard to his company's software.</p>
						
						<p>In the letter, Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company's 
						Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread unauthorized copying 
						in effect discourages developers from investing time and money in creating high-quality software. 
						He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors' time, effort, and capital without paying them.</p>

							"Well, it actually began with the start of computers, because at that time

							change this software, even if it’s necessary for you to fix it for your own
							application.” And, you can actually blame some of that on Microsoft, they

					<section>
						You see, because to get one of the modern computers of the day, which was the early 80s, you would 
						have to get a proprietary operating system, but the developers of those systems, didn’t share with 
						other people, instead they tried to control the users, dominated the users, restricted them, saying: 
						to get this system, you have to sign a promise you won’t share it with anybody else.
					</section>
					
					<section>
						And for some people that was like promise to be a bad person, to betray or cut yourself off

							### Richard Matthew Stallman
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section>
						Richard Stallman, is the founding father of the Free Software Movement.
						Through his efforts to build the GNU operating system, he created the legal,
						philosophical and technological foundation for the Free Software Movement.
						<br> <br>
						Without these contributions it’s unlikely that Linux and Open Source would
						have evolved into their current forms today.
					</section>

					<section>
						In the late 70s and early 80s, Richard was doing Artificial Intelligence research and coding 
						at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Lab.
						And during that period he had enough numbers of negative experience with commercial 
						software, that put him into a moral dilemma of developing another operating system, 
						a system that he as author could share it to everyone, say everyone you can come and 
						get it, use this, form a new community.
						<br>
						So he began developing his own operating system - the GNU.
						
					</section>

					<section data-markdown>
						<textarea data-template>
							## GNU
						</textarea>
					</section>
					<section>
						The name GNU is a recursive acronym. It stands for Gnu’s Not Unix.
						<br>
						Because he was developing a system that was like the Unix
						Operating System, but was not the Unix Operating System, this was a
						different system, he would have to write it completely from scratch, because
						Unix was proprietary.

					</section>

					<section>
						So formally Richard founded the Free Software Movement in 1983 by launching 
						the GNU Project. He start writing a replacement for one program, and then 
						another, and then another, and he published an announcement inviting other 
						people to join him to help write these programs, and people started joining 
						him to help write these programs.
					</section>

					<section>
						<blockquote style="font-size: 36px; width: auto;">
							The crucial thing about GNU is that it’s free software. Now free software
							refers not to price but to freedom, so think of free speech, not free beer. The
							freedoms that I’m talking about are the freedoms to make changes if you
							want to, or hire somebody else to make changes for you, if you’re using a
							software for your business, to redistribute copies, to share with other people
							and to make improvements and publish them, so other people can get the
							benefit of them too. And those are the freedoms that distinguish free software
							from non-free software. These are the freedoms that enable people to form a
							community. If you don’t have all these freedoms, you’re being divided and
							dominated by somebody.

						<p>
							The <strong>free software movement</strong>  - is a social movement with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain 
							freedoms for software users, namely the freedom to run the software, to study and change the 
							software, and to redistribute copies with or without changes.
						</p> <br>
						<p>Later Stallman established the Free Software Foundation in 1985 to support the movement.</p>
					</section>

					<section>The <strong>Free Software Foundation (FSF)</strong> <br>
						is a non-profit organization founded to support the free software movement, 
						which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software, 
						with the organization's preference for software being distributed under copyleft ("share alike") terms, such as with its own GNU General Public License.

					<section>
						<blockquote style="font-size: 32px; width: auto;">
							"If we put the software in the public domain, somebody else would be able to
							make a little bit of change and turn that into a proprietary software package,
							which means that the users would be running our software, but they wouldn’t
							have freedom to cooperate and share. To prevent that we use a technique
							called copy-left. The idea of copy-left is copyright flipped over. And what we
							do is, we say, “this software is copyrighted and we, the authors, give you
							permission to redistribute copies, we give you permission to change it, we
							give you permission to add to it, but when you redistribute it, it has to be
							under these terms, no more or no less, so that whoever gets it from you, also
							gets the freedom to cooperate with other people if he wants to.” And this
							way, everywhere the software goes, the freedom goes too, and it becomes
							an inevitable right to cooperate with other people and form a community."

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>As an example of such kind of license is the GNU General Public License - a widely-used free 
							software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.</p>
						<p>The license was originally written by Richard Stallman, former head of the Free Software Foundation (FSF),

							one that Richard Stallman wrote and I think it’s a really astounding

							company, or, as is the case with the M.I.T. and BSD license, performing the

					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Not immediately, but quite early in the project, 
							the GNU and FSF developments were involved: the ability to develop a kernel by anyone was legalized with the GPL license,

						</blockquote>
						-Bruce Perens
					</section>


					<section>Right № 1: 
						<p class="font-bigger">Free Redistribution</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The first right is Free Redistribution. This doesn’t mean free as no price, it
						means liberty. You have to be free to redistribute your software to someone
						else. And actually, no price is a side-effect, you can charge for that
						redistribution or not.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 2: 
						<p class="font-bigger">Source Code Available</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						It has to come with source code, so that someone can maintain a program; if
						they go from a PC to a Mac, for example, they can change the software.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 3: 
						<p class="font-bigger">Derived Works Permitted</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Derived Works have to be possible; if someone has to improve your
						program, they should be able to distribute the result.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 4: 
						<p class="font-bigger">Integrity of The Author's Source Code</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						There is a provision about the Integrity of the Author’s Source Code, which
						says that the author can sort of maintain their honor and if you make a
						change, you might have to change the name of the program, or mark out
						your change very clearly, so your change doesn’t reflect on the author.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 5: 
						<p class="font-bigger">No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The license must not discriminate against any person or group of persons.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 6: 
						<p class="font-bigger">No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						There is no discrimination against fields of endeavor; and that means, the
						software has to be usable in a business, as well as in a school.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 7: 
						<p class="font-bigger">Distribution of License</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The license has to be distributable; in other words, I have to be able to give
						that license to someone and that license then should work if that someone
						gives it to yet a third person.
					</section>

					<section>Right № 8: 
						<p class="font-bigger">License Must Not Be Specific to a Product</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The license can’t be specific to a product; in other words, if I distribute my
						software on a Red Hat System, the license can’t say: you can’t distribute this
						on a SuSE or a Debian system.
					</section>


					<section>Right № 9: 
						<p class="font-bigger">License Must Not Restrict Other Software</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						The license must not place restrictions on other software that is distributed along with the licensed software. 
						For example, the license must not insist that all other programs distributed on the same medium must be open-source software.
					</section>

					<section>
						And after a while, there was a Right № 10: 
						<p class="font-bigger">License Must Be Technology-Neutral</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						No provision of the license may be predicated on any individual technology or style of interface.
					</section>

					<section>
						And then the only other part of the Open Source Definition is a list of licenses
						that were accepted. And the ones that we started with were the GPL, which
						was actually the example for a lot of what’s in the Open Source Definition,
						the BSD license, because software for the BSD system pre-existed Linux.
					</section>

					</section>

					<section>And that's the point where ideologies diverged.</section>
				</section>

				
				<section>
					<section>Let's summarize what we've got</section>
					<section>
						The term Open Source was created as an alternative to Free Software.
						<br>
						To be short - terms open source is a development philosophy that is 
						more business oriented, and free software is a social and moral philosophy. 
						That’s why the term open source is more palatable to the corporate 
						world because it places less emphasis on freedom. 
					</section>

					<section>
							Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely 
							accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) 
							by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and 
							distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.
							<br>
							There's also a public benefit corporation called The Open Source Initiative, 
							that promotes the usage of Open Source Software and assesses licenses to 
							comply with the Open Source Definition.
					</section>
	
					<section>
							Lastly I want to say that "open source" designates a broader set 
							of values — what is called "the open source way". Open source projects, 
							products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open 
							exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, 
							meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
