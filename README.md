## Open Source movement/ideology

`(What is open source?)`

The term Open Source refers to something people can modify and share because it's design is publicly accessible.
The term originated in the context of software development to designate a specific approach to creating computer programs.

`(For better understanding, let's dive into the depths of history!)`

The history of the phenomenon goes back to ancient times. When computers were the size of a small house. 
Copyright manners were free, programmers' deeds went from hand to hand and one research institute to another, everyone was satisfied, no one complained.
But in 1976, Bill Gates appeared with his angry letter, the so-called "The Open Letter to Hobbyists". The letter was written to early personal computer hobbyists, in which Gates express dismay at the rampant software piracy taking place in the hobbyist community.

`(The beginning of the end of freedom)`

So it's began in the late 70s, early 80s, that people started really closing up their software and saying, that you can never get a look at the source code, you can’t change this software, even if it’s necessary for you to fix it for your own application.

You see, because to get one of the modern computers of the early 80s, you would have to get a proprietary operating system, but the developers of those systems, didn’t share with other people, instead they tried to control the users, dominated the users, restricted them, saying: to get this system, you have to sign a promise you won’t share it with anybody else.
And for some people that was like a promise to be a bad person, to betray or cut yourself off from society, from the cooperating community. One of them was Richard Stollman.

`(Richard Matthew Stallman)`

Richard Stallman, is the founding father of the Free Software Movement. Through his efforts to build the GNU operating system, he created the legal, philosophical and technological foundation for the Free Software Movement.

In the late 70s and early 80s, Richard was doing Artificial Intelligence research and coding at the M.I.T. Artificial Intelligence Lab.
And during that period he had enough numbers of negative experience with commercial software, that put him into a moral dilemma of developing another operating system, a system that he as author could share it to everyone, say everyone you can come and get it, use this, form a new community.
So he began developing his own operating system - the GNU.

`(GNU)`

The name GNU is a recursive acronym. It stands for Gnu’s Not Unix.
Because he was developing a system that was like the Unix Operating System, but wasn't the Unix Operating System, this was a different system, he would have to write it completely from scratch, because Unix was proprietary.

So formally Richard founded the Free Software Movement in 1983 by launching the GNU Project. He start writing a replacement for one program, and then another, and then another, and he published an announcement inviting other people to join him to help write these programs, and people started joining him to help write these programs.

The crucial thing about GNU is that it’s free software. Now free software refers not to price but to freedom, so think of free speech, not free beer.
The freedoms to make changes if you want to, to redistribute copies, to share with other people and to make improvements and publish them, so other people can get the benefit of them too. And those are the freedoms that distinguish free software from non-free software.

`(Free Software Movement)`

The free software movement - is a social movement with the goal of obtaining and guaranteeing certain freedoms for software users, to support the movement, Stallman established the Free Software Foundation in 1985, which promotes the universal freedom to study, distribute, create, and modify computer software.


`(Free sortware generally does have a copyright, it does have an owner, and it has a license. It is not public domain)`

To prevent free software being public domain we use a technique called copy-left. The idea of copy-left is copyright flipped over. And what we do is, we say, “this software is copyrighted, and we, the authors, give you permission to redistribute copies, we give you permission to change it, we give you permission to add to it, but when you redistribute it, it has to be under these terms, no more or no less, so that whoever gets it from you, also gets the freedom to cooperate with other people if he wants to.” And this way, everywhere the software goes, the freedom goes too.

An example of such a license is the GNU General Public License that - a widely-used free software license that guarantees end users the freedom to run, study, share, and modify the software.


`(GNU General Public License)`

GNU General Public License was written by Richard Stallman from the standpoint of the community, rather than from the standpoint of protecting a company, or performing the goals of a government grant program.
And the GPL is really unique in that. It’s not just a license, it’s a whole philosophy that motivated the Open Source Definition, a particular document in a legalese which accomplishes it's job. And a lot of people use that license, for example Linus Torvalds uses the same license for Linux, too.

`(Linus Torvalds)`

By about 1991, the GNU Project had replaced practically all the needed software, except for the kernel. And here comes some Finnish Swede named Linus Torvalds decided to write his own UNIX-like operating system and started with the kernel, because it is more interesting. 
And so it turned out that he used the GNU components to create the kernel, thereby filling the last gap in the GNU system. But he didn't know this.
His kernel is called Linux.

`(Linux)`

When the first version of the product was ready, Linus decided to share his work with other enthusiasts like himself. The project quickly gathered around itself enough brainy people for it's successful development, and Linus turned out to be a successful leader of the new movement and phenomenon.
Not immediately, but quite early the GNU and FSF developments were involved: the ability to develop a kernel by anyone was legalized with the GPL license, and merging the kernel with already written GNU applications and components gave the world its first complete free operating system, GNU/Linux.

So Linux and Free Software pick up momentum.
But there was a problem...

`("Free software" is not something that businesses want to hear)`

People took the term "free" and associated it with free of charge, they thought that it couldn’t make money or couldn’t sell, which is exactly the wrong concept.
You had to make it clear that the software was open and that the source code was available. 

And the group of people in the free software movement, who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy, had meeting at the VA offices in Mountain View, where the term "free software" was first proposed.
Also there was needed a definition, some kind of a meta-license to define the term Open Source. 
And that's how the "Open Source Definition" document came about.

`(Open Source Definition)`

Originally that was a document that says "Open Source is software that gives you a list of nine rights, which is in the Open Source Definition", but later one more right was added to that list.

Right № 1: Free Redistribution

Right № 2: Source Code Available

Right № 3: Derived Works Permitted

Right № 4: Integrity of The Author's Source Code

Right № 5: No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups

Right № 6: No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor

Right № 7: Distribution of License

Right № 8: License Must Not Be Specific to a Product

Right № 9: License Must Not Restrict Other Software

Right № 10: License Must Be Technology-Neutral

The only other part of the Open Source Definition is a list of licenses that were accepted.
And now when the term has been coined, it leads to another problem...

`(Open source != free software)`

In Stollman's opinion the promotion of open source is somewhat detrimental to free software, that people stop at Open Source, not reaching the notion of freedom. 
Open source implies that free software and non-free software should co-exist, but according to Richard all software should be free, that this freedom is even more important, than having powerful and reliable software.
And that's the point where ideologies diverged.

`(So, let's summarize what we've got)`

The term Open Source was created as an alternative to Free Software.
To be short - terms open source is a development philosophy that is more business oriented, and free software is a social and moral philosophy. 
That’s why the term open source is more palatable to the corporate world because it places less emphasis on freedom. 

Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition.
There's also a public benefit corporation called The Open Source Initiative, that promotes the usage of Open Source Software and assesses licenses to comply with the Open Source Definition.

Lastly I want to say that "open source" designates a broader set of values — what is called "the open source way". Open source projects, products, or initiatives embrace and celebrate principles of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development.
